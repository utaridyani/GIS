## About The Project

A website that allows users to mark a specific section of a road, add markers, and save data about that road section into a database can be built using Laravel as the framework and Leaflet for the map functionality.

### Key Features
1. Road Section Marking: Users can select and mark specific sections of a road on an interactive map.
2. Adding Markers: Users can place markers on the map to indicate points of interest or specific locations along the road.
3. Database Integration: All data related to the marked road sections and added markers are stored in a database for future reference and analysis.
